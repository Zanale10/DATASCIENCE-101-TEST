        "3.\tWhy is version control important in collaborative data science projects?\n",
        "Version control really matters in collaborative data science projects because It helps track changes in the code, so you always know what was changed, when, and by who. It also makes collaboration across teams easier since everyone can work on the same project without accidentally messing up each other’s work. And there’s always a backup with the full work history, so nothing gets lost.\n",
